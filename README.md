# Death data structure

Exploratory data structure. Initially based on examination of the exemplar forms
in the [Death Certification Reforms consultation](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/death-certification-reforms).

## The death

The wrapper for the other pieces.

## The deceased

Information about the deceased person.

## Participants

Who might be part of the establishment of a cause of death? Both in terms of a
defined role and being an information source?

Split into two basic groups:

### Practitioners

* The deceased’s GP
* The deceased’s hospital consultant
* The deceased’s last carer
* The qualified attending practitioner (QAP)
* The medical examiner (ME)
* Medical examiner’s officer (MEO)
* The coroner
* Coroner’s officer
* The registrar of births, deaths and marriages

### “Civilian”

* Next of kin
* Partner
* Relatives
* Representatives

## Cause of death

What is the cause of death? Increments of how the agreed cause was arrived at.

## Scrutiny

What records have been scrutinised? By whom? What is the synopsis of this
scrutiny?

## Examination

Information about any physical examination that has taken place as part of the
ME process.

## Events

The ME workflow has at least three “events”:

* Notification of death
* Discussion of death between ME and QAP
* Discussion of death between ME or MEO and the informant
